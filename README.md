# Hippocampus Delta Analysis - UFRN BSc 20/21

This repository contains my research on rat's hippocampus trying to understand how delta waves acts in rat's hippocampus.

## Abstract

Recent studies have reported the occurrence of 2-4 Hz oscillations in the hippocampus of rats performing stationary locomotion on treadmills and virtual reality apparatus that are essentially absent during translational locomotion through the environment. Due to its apparent similarities with theta (6-10 Hz) oscillations, such as a positive relationship with running speed, many raised the question whether these two rhythms are interrelated or independently generated. To answer this question, we analyzed LFPs and spiking activity from the dorsal CA1 while rats performed a spatial alternation task on an U-shaped maze and ran for 15s in a running wheel during the intertrial intervals. We observed the rise of 4-Hz oscillations while rats ran in the wheel but not maze. The 4-Hz amplitude correlated positively with wheel speed and negatively with maze speed. The amplitude of 4-Hz and theta oscillations were inversely correlated. 4-Hz osciiations were not associated with spatial choice performance. Pharmacological inactivation of the medial septum abolished hippocampal theta but preserved 4-Hz oscillations. Finally, 4-Hz oscillations entrained rhythmic spiking activity from pyramidal cells and interneurons. These results dissociate the underlying mechanism of 4-Hz and theta oscillations in the rat hippocampus.
